Problem 1. Please write ONE SQL statement for each of the following tasks using tables created in Problem 1. Note that you can only use conditions specified in the task description and cannot manually look up data and add conditions.
For example, if you want to look up a client named 'Ella', you have to match the client's name with 'Ella'. You cannot manually find out the ID of client whose name is Ella.

Task 1: return name of the support staff assigned to the ticket submitted by Ella on October 1st 2022. 
You can use trunc(tktime) to get the date of the ticket submission time.  

select sname 
from support s, ticket t, client c
where s.sid = t.sid and t.clid = c.clid and clname = 'Ella' and trunc(tktime) = date '2022-10-1';

-- result nancy 



join + group by 
Question 2: return names of each support staff and number of tickets assigned to that staff 

select sname, count(*) 
from support s, ticket t 
where s.sid = t.sid 
group by sname;

-- Nancy 2 
-- Ethan 1

-- join + group by + having 

Question 3: return names of clients who have submitted at least two tickets. 

select clname 
from client c, ticket t  
where c.clid = t.clid 
group by c.clname 
having count(*) >=2;

-- Ella
-- Olivia


-- self join. 
Question 4: Return names of topics whose parent is 'computing technology'. 

select t2.tname
from topic t1, topic t2 
where t1.tname = 'computing technology' and t1.tid = t2.ptid;

-- network connection, software, email. 

-- subquery 
Question 5: update the status of ticket table to 2 if there is a row in ticket_detail that has the same ticket ID and the content is 'ticket assigned to support staff'.

update ticket 
set status = 2
where tkid in (
select tkid 
from ticket_detail td  
where  content = 'ticket assigned to support staff'
);

-- 4 rows updated.
